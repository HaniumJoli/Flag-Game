# Flag Game

Flag Game is a simple and fun SwiftUI-based game where users are challenged to guess the correct flag from a set of three options. The app keeps track of the user's score, rewarding correct answers and penalizing incorrect ones.

## Features

- **Randomized Flags**: The flags are shuffled each time a new question is presented.
- **Score Tracking**: The app keeps track of the user's score, which is displayed on the main screen and in an alert after each guess.
- **Interactive UI**: The app uses SwiftUI for a modern and responsive user interface.
